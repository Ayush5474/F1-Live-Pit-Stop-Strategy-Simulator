# F1-Live-Pit-Stop-Strategy-Simulator
"Live Pit Stop Strategy Simulator" is an interactive "Streamlit app" that simulates Formula 1 pit stop strategies in real-time.   It uses a "Random Forest model" trained on a sample dataset of tracks, weather, laps, and tire wear to predict the "optimal pit stop strategy" as the race unfolds.
